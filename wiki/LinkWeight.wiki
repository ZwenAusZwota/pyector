#summary How to compute the weight of a link?
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

The weight of a link, or the _influence_ of the incoming node to the outgoing one, is computed depending on the incoming node's occurrence and on the co-occurrence of the two nodes (co-occurrence is an attribute of the link).


= Details =

When the link is not labeled, the formula is simple:

_weight,,ij,,_ = _co-occ,,ij,,_ / _occ,,i,,_

#summary What is a Concept Network?
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

A Concept Network is a net made of nodes and weighted links between them. It can be wholy connected.

= A concept =

A concept is a set of nodes in the Concept Network, strongly bound together and simultaneously activated. Thus, when nodes named `network`, `neural`, `Widrow`, `Kohonen`, and `Hoff` are in a Concept Network, one can assume that they constitute one concept, different from the one constituted by `Markov`, `hidden`, though the `network` node could belong to the _hidden Markov network_ concept.

This is true, only if the Concept Network was designed in order to associate conceptually near symbols. 


= Node =

Each node has these fields:

  - symbol (S):
    it contains the symbolic information. 
  - occurrence (occ):
    number of times it occurred (in ECTOR case, how many times it appeared in user's utterance).
  - type:
    what type of node it is (depends on the application). For ECTOR, they can be "token", "sentence", "sentiment", "expression", "utterer", "label", "file", .... See NodeType.
